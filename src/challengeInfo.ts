 * Given this API:

 *
 * Create a way to input a text.
 * Use Search API with the input to list the books found.
 * We only want to show the title, first year published and,
 * finally, the cover.
 * 
 * Everything should be centered in the screen.
 * The list of books should be horizontal and scrollable. 
 * 
 * > Limit the results to 25.
 * > Can we filter books with only one Edition Count?
 * > Can we grab only the fields we need to optimize
 *   the network request?
 * > Can we debounce the fetch of the data after input to avoid
 *   firing too much requests while typing?
